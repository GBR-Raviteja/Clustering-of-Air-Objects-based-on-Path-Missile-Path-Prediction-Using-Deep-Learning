# Clustering-of-Air-Objects-based-on-Path-Missile-Path-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
This paper classifies air objects like drones, aircraft, and missiles by clustering trajectories using RNN and LSTM deep learning. It predicts missile paths for target interception, achieving high accuracy (LSTM r2: 0.997 for object clustering, 0.791 for path prediction).
