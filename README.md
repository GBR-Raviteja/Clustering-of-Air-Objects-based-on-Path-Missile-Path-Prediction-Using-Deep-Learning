# Clustering of Air Objects Based on Path, Missile Path Prediction Using Deep Learning

This repository summarizes the IEEE publication on classifying and predicting trajectories of air objects and missiles using deep learning.

## Abstract
Presents trajectory-based clustering of various aerial objects—drones, planes, missiles—using RNN and LSTM networks. Predicts missile paths for interception, with LSTM models achieving high r2 scores for classification and prediction.

## Key Features
- Clustering of air objects by analyzing 4D trajectories
- Deep learning models: RNN & LSTM applied to trajectory data
- Missile path prediction to optimize target interception
- Experiments showing high accuracy (object clustering r2: 0.997, missile path r2: 0.791)

## Technologies
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Python (recommended platform)
- Air object trajectory datasets

## How to Use
1. Gather and preprocess trajectory data in 4D (latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity).
2. Train RNN/LSTM models for object clustering and path prediction.
3. Use prediction outputs to support missile guidance and airspace management.
